  <h1 id="what--why">What &amp; Why</h1>

<p>There are countless CI options out there. Transitioning from one CI system to
another can be a huge investment depending on the size of your project.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="easy-to-learn">Easy to learn</h2>

<p>Over the years, you've probably learned way too many little details about how
your CI system operates.</p>

<p>Concourse is a response to the complexity introduced by other systems. It is
built from as few distinct concepts as possible. To learn them, see
<a href="/concepts">Concepts</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="no-build-pollution">No build pollution</h2>

<p>Every build executes in a container, isolated from the rest. Multiple teams can
use the same Concourse deployment without worrying about stepping on each
other's toes (barring resource contention).</p>

<p>The base image for each job's builds is configurable, and supports Docker
images. Control your build's runtime environment as part of your project that
needs it, not your worker VMs.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="scalable-reproducible-deployment">Scalable, reproducible deployment</h2>

<p>Concourse is statically configurable (by humans) and can be (re)created from
scratch from a single BOSH deploy. Adding more workers is as easy as bumping a
number in your BOSH deployment manifest.</p>

<p>See <a href="/configuring">Configuring</a> and <a href="/deploying">Deploying</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="usable">Usable</h2>

<p>Concourse is optimized for quickly navigating to the pages you most care about.
From the main page, the shortest path from a pipeline view to the console
output of a job's latest failing build is a single click.</p>

<p>From there, the job's entire build history is displayed, and every input for
the job is listed out, with any new inputs highlighted.</p>

<p>The build log is colorized and supports unicode. It emulates your terminal and
gets out of your way.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="flexible">Flexible</h2>

<p>Concourse provides the abstractions for you to be able to integrate with
anything you need, and implements most interesting features in terms of this
same primitive. See <a href="/concepts/03-resources.html">Resources</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="local-iteration">Local iteration</h2>

<p>Everyone knows this dance: set up CI, push, build fails. Fix config, push,
build fails… 20 commits later, success.</p>

<p>Concourse's support for running builds locally eliminates this pesky workflow,
and allows you to trust that your build running locally runs <em>exactly</em> the same
way that it runs in your CI system.</p>

<p>The workflow then becomes: set up CI, configure build locally, <code>fly</code>, build
fails (we can't fix that), fix things up, <code>fly</code>…</p>

<p>At the end of this, instead of 20 junk commits pushed to your repo, you've
figured out a configuration for both running locally and running in CI.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bootstrapped">Bootstrapped</h2>

<p>Proving all of this works is hard without having a real use case. Thankfully,
Concourse itself is a sufficiently large piece of work that its own pipeline
has been plenty to cut its teeth on.</p>

<p>At the start of the pipeline are jobs configured for each individual component.
These jobs simply run their unit tests, and are the first line of defense.</p>

<p>The versions of each component that make it through this stage are then fed
into an integration job that literally spins every component up in a room and
makes them talk to each other.</p>

<p>From there, the Docker images used for the resource types within the
integration build are shipped, and the ref of each successful resource is
bumped in the BOSH release repository.</p>

<p>Because the release repo changed, a Deploy job kicks in, which literally
<em>deploys to the same instance running the Deploy job</em>. Concourse's own
pipeline drives out the need for deploys to not trash every running build.</p>

<p>After a deploy succeeds, the Concourse version number resource is bumped, and
new artifacts are available for shipping into a new release.</p>

<p>At any point in time, I can walk in and trigger the <code>shipit</code> job, which takes
the most recently built release candidate, bumps its version resource to a
final number (<code>0.3.0.rc.3</code> to <code>0.3.0</code>), and uploads a <code>.tgz</code> to the S3 bucket
containing final releases.</p>

<p>Though the above chain of events may sound complicated, in reality it is just a
bunch of simple functions of inputs → outputs.</p>

<p>The way I've described this pipeline flow is precisely how each job is
configured, and automatically visualized on the main page:</p>

<p><a href="/images/concourse-pipeline.png"><img class="pipeline" src="/images/concourse-pipeline.png" alt="Concourse Pipeline" /></a></p>

<p>Initially this array of squares may be a lot to take in, but on your own
projects, where <em>reality</em> is this complicated, you'll appreciate the
straightforward expression of every relationship.</p>
