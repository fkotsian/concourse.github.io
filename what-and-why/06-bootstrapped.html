<p>Proving all of this works is hard without having a real use case. Thankfully,
Concourse itself is a sufficiently large piece of work that its own pipeline
has been plenty to cut its teeth on.</p>

<p>At the start of the pipeline are jobs configured for each individual component.
These jobs simply run their unit tests, and are the first line of defense.</p>

<p>The versions of each component that make it through this stage are then fed
into an integration job that literally spins every component up in a room and
makes them talk to each other.</p>

<p>From there, the Docker images used for the resource types within the
integration build are shipped, and the ref of each successful resource is
bumped in the BOSH release repository.</p>

<p>Because the release repo changed, a Deploy job kicks in, which literally
<em>deploys to the same instance running the Deploy job</em>. Concourse's own
pipeline drives out the need for deploys to not trash every running build.</p>

<p>After a deploy succeeds, the Concourse version number resource is bumped, and
new artifacts are available for shipping into a new release.</p>

<p>At any point in time, I can walk in and trigger the <code>shipit</code> job, which takes
the most recently built release candidate, bumps its version resource to a
final number (<code>0.3.0.rc.3</code> to <code>0.3.0</code>), and uploads a <code>.tgz</code> to the S3 bucket
containing final releases.</p>

<p>Though the above chain of events may sound complicated, in reality it is just a
bunch of simple functions of inputs â†’ outputs.</p>

<p>The way I've described this pipeline flow is precisely how each job is
configured, and automatically visualized on the main page:</p>

<p>Initially this array of squares may be a lot to take in, but on your own
projects, where <em>reality</em> is this complicated, you'll appreciate the
straightforward expression of every relationship.</p>
